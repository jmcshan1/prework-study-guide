# Prework Study Guide
## Description

I want to make sure that I am adequately prepared for the bootcamp and that I have all knowledge required of me before it starts. This study guide was made to help me and maybe future students of NWU bootcamp with the prework required for the corse. The prework, while you are  required to have any technical background to complete, is still a lot of information to take in if your are learning this type of stuff for the first time. The study guide notes down what and how parts of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript are used in the different modules of the prework. Student can use the study guide if the forgot what something does or how its used. I learned how to use the basic elements of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and a little of how they all work together.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. You can refer to this guide while you are doing the prework. It can also be used after you complete the prework to help commit what you learned to memory. There are also messages in the console that can be view when you open the DevTools console. The message picks out a randomized topic out of the 4 subjects mentioned before. You can use this if you are struggling on which topic you want to study.
